To solve the nonlinear MPC problem, we use a barrier function method to enforce
state constraints and the GODLIKE solver (https://github.com/rodyo/FEX-GODLIKE).

File Descriptions (in order of full algorithm, see [1]):

1) main_collect_samples:        generates low-discrepancy Halton samples and solves the
                                NMPC problem at each sample to collect feasibility and
                                control information.

2) main_feasible_region_SVM:    generates an approximation of the feasible region using
                                samples collected in main_collect_samples.m.
                                The inner approximation is not automated in this version
                                but can be constructed by taking sublevel sets of the SVM
                                decision boundary enforced by the variable 'feas_threshold'.
                                For complete automation of the inner approximation, we
                                recommend using scikit-learn in Python.
                                After constructing the inner approximation, resampling is
                                performed to get a rich enough dataset for controller construction.

3) main_approx_NMPC:            constructs approximate NMPC using Chebyshev polynomials and
                                regression and tests the controller in closed-loop using the 
                                Simulink file 'simulation_ENMPC.slx' in continuous-time.

Function list:

1) constraint_violated:         checks state constraint violation

2) find_optimal_NMPC:           computes optimal NMPC action given a state and constraints

3) model:                       implements nonlinear model investigated in Chen and Allgower,
                                Automatica, 1998.

4) objFncMPC:                   MPC objective function (quadratic cost can be altered to other cost)
